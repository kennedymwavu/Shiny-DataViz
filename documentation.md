This web application generates tables and visuals for the dataset you provide.
Your dataset should be in the same format as the one below, ie. `Sample Dataset`. The rows MUST be in that order. Your data may not have the exact row names as the sample     dataset. All you need to do is match your rows to their equivalent. 

For example, you may have the row `Gross Written Premium`. Looking at the `Sample Dataset` we find its equivalent to be `Gross Direct Premium`. Now put your `Gross Written Premium` in the same row number as `Gross Direct Premium`.

You can download any summary dataset or its visuals via the available download           buttons.
